	      <h3> Research Project </h3>
	      <br/>	 
		In this course, you will complete a mini-research project of a self-contained idea in visualization. 
		<br/>This project will be completed in groups of two. The milestones are as follows:
		   
		<ul class="news">
			<li> <h3> DUE 29 JAN. </h3>  <b> Project Abstract </b> (5 pts)</li>
			<li> <h3> DUE 12 FEB. </h3>  <b> Mid-term review </b> (10 pts) </li>
			<li> <h3> DUE 2 APR. </h3>  <b> Project presentation </b> (25 pts) </li>
			<li> <h3> DUE 15 APR. </h3>  <b> Research report </b> (10 pts)</li>
	  	</ul> 
		    
		<p> At a high level, successful projects raise a question about visualization, and plan and execute a project for answering that question. 
			Most projects build and evaluate a prototype system, but hacking is not strictly necessary. 
			Note that a research contribution is not equal to engineering: the methodology employed, the originality of the research and technical soundness of the work are most important. 
			A well-crafted application will not be a subsitute for research quality and contribution.</p>
		    
		<p> All projects require an evaluation — obviously a much more thorough study will be expected of projects that do not involve system building (e.g. perceptual studies). 
		    In-depth qualitative studies (with rich discussion on implications for visualization design) are also suitable as a research project
			[see for instance <a href="http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/supplemental/Active-Reading-of-Visualizations/walny2017_activereading%20(preprint).pdf">Active Reading in Visualization</a>, 
			and <a href="http://hci.usask.ca/uploads/173-pap0297-bateman.pdf"> Useful Junk?</a>]. 
			Similarly to a project involving developement, the methodology, originality and technical soundness of the work will be evaluated. </p>
			
		<p> The goal of the project abstract draft (described below) is to help you scope your work appropriately.</p>

		<header class="major">
		  <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
		</header>

		 <p>An important part of your course work is to articulate a research question and make a plan to address it. 
		 To do this, you'll need to: 1) read a lot of papers in an area of interest, and 2) generate a lot of ideas. 
		 Leveraging an existing project on campus will get you to a novel idea quicker, increase your impact, and be more rewarding. </p>
		 
		      
		<h4> Description </h4>
		<p>
			A <b>meaningful title</b> and <b>abstract</b> describing your project.</p>
		<p> The abstract (max 1 page) can be seen as a preliminary draft of the introduction of the research paper (project report) that you will submit at the end of the term. 
			It should describe the topic of your project (motivation, e.g., why it is important (why care? who cares?), why it is difficult) 
			and the research question that you are trying to address, 
			possibly a brief positionning (what has been done in the area, and why these prior works are limited; 
			what are prior works you bear inspiration from and why), a description of your envisionned research methodology and associated risks.
		</p>

		      <p> Please also attach a <b>short biography</b> (a few words about you and why you take this class), as well as a <b>portrait photograph</b> (headshot) of yourself.</p>

		<p>
		<h4> How will it be graded? </h4>
		Refer the <a href="rubrics/project-abstract.pdf">detailed rubric</a> for more guidance on what is expected in this assignment.</p>
		      
		<p>
		<h4> Submission instructions </h4>
		&#9648; Due on <b>29 Jan., no later than 5pm.</b><br/>
		&#9648; Submit your abstract (max 1 page excluding images, references and bios) in the PDF format on Quercus. 
		&#9648; Make sure your submission includes a project title, and the name, short biography and headshot of the group members.

		  <h2>Mid-term review</h2>
		</header>

		<h4> Description </h4>
		<p>
		  A short presentation (<5min) of your project.<br/>
		  As for the project abstract, the presentation should cover the following aspects: topic of your project; what is the research question that you are trying to address? 
		 why is it important (why care? who cares?),  your envisionned research methodology and progress to date.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h4> Submission instructions </h4>
		      &#9648; Submit your presentation materials on Quercus before <b>Feb. 12, 10am.</b>.
		      &#9648; Presentations will be graded on <b>13 Feb.</b> during the class.<br/>
		      &#9648; <i> Presentations may be recorded for grading purpose (internal use only).</i>

		  <h2>Project presentation</h2>
		</header>

		<h4> Description </h4>

		<p>
		 The final presentation should mostly focus on the work you have realized, 
			your research contribution (i.e., field study, formative study, design rationales, demo/description of the solution, evaluation, ...). 
			Intro / motivation / related work, while worth including, should remain concise. </p>
			
		<p>At the end of the term, you will present your research results to the class and possibly outside guests.
			<br/> &#9648; Each pair will have <b>10 minutes to present<b>. This time limit will be strictly enforced, and your time begins as soon as the previous group ends. 
			Any technical difficulty will be counted within your time. 
			<br/> &#9648; Three pairs will form a 'session'. There will be 3 minutes of Q&A after each presentation.
			<br/> &#9648; Please bring adapters for your laptop, and check it works well by coming early to the presentation session.
			<br/> &#9648; To reiterate: Test (and debug) your laptop video projection before presentations begin. Time spent fiddling with display settings will count against your presentation time.
			<br/> &#9648; Structure your presentation like a pyramid — begin with a one-sentence statement of your research result (a teaser video of your interactive prototype works well at the beginning to pique the audience's interest and curiosity.). 
			This will get everyone on the same page. Then, offer a short description of what you did and why you did it. 
			Then, explain things in detail.
			<br/> &#9648; This presentation is short enough that you can write out everything you want to say long-hand. Do this! This will allow you to convey information efficiently and effectively. Read through it enough times so that you have it basically memorized, but not so memorized that you get flustered if you skip a word or someone asks a question.
			<br/> &#9648; Know your audience! You can expect that everyone in the class knows everything you learned in class. So, you don't need to re-introduce the whole field of HCI. A sentence or two to situate your work in the field is good, but spend the rest of the time telling us what you did.
			<br/> &#9648; When presenting, stand near your slides. And look at the audience.
			<br/> &#9648; Make sure axis labels on all graphs are large enough for the audience to read. Often, graphing programs generate labels that are too small. And in general, start the y-axis at 0, and show the standard error as "whiskers".
			<br/> &#9648; Make sure to state who your participants were in your study.
			<br/> &#9648; When describing your study, show an example (e.g. screenshot or sample question) of what the participants did or saw.

		<h4> Submission instructions </h4>
		&#9648; Submit your presentation materials on Quercus before <b>Apr. 2, 10am.</b>.
		&#9648; Presentations will be graded on <b>2 Apr.</b> (sessions to be announced).<br/>

		  <h2>Research report</h2>
		</header>
		In addition to the presentation, you will present your findings in a final paper.
		      
		<h4> Description </h4>

		<p>
		 Final papers should be 3-5 pages long in the <a href="">two-column CHI format</a>. While this may sound short, it is much harder to write an effective, complete short paper than it is to ramble. A good approach to writing a great short paper is to write a long one first, and then trim it down to the most vital parts. Appendices are acceptable and optional (they don't count towards the page limit), but won't be graded. Add one for materials you want an interested reader to see (for example, when we post your project on the website for next year), but don't need to be graded. Page limit includes references.
		 The fina report should be seen as a research paper submission, short format (4-6 pages, references do not count toward page limit). 
		 As such, it should include all of the components of a reaserach paper (strong motivation, positioning, clear statement of the reseach question and contribution, ...). 
		 Most of the papers presented in class are good example of good quality research papers (you should read all papers presented in this class!).
