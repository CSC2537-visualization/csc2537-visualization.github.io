	  <h4> RESEARCH PROJECT (50 pts) </h4>
    Students will complete a mini-research project in groups of two. We encourge students to choose projects that are related to their own research or another research project on campus. Leveraging ongoing research increases your speed and ability to find define a good project, and enables you to leverage existing software and hardware infrastructure. 
    The grade for this portion will be broken up as follows:

    <p> <b> 5 pts - Project Abstract Draft, including research question </b>:
    The strength of the research problem (i.e., do pick something that's research, not just development) and appropriateness of the scope (i.e., don't pick something too large — it's only a 12-week term.) Is it executed in ways necessary to understand your research question? (It doesn't need to be functional in ways orthogonal to your research question.)</p>

    <p> <b> 10 pts - Mid-term presentation </b> </p> 
    
    <p> <b> 25 pts - Final Report, including execution</b>: Explanation of your ideas, motivation, and related work. How well did you figure out what you set out to learn?</p>

    <p> <b> 10 pts - Project Presentation</b>: In general, both members of the team will receive the same grade. However, if there is a significant contribution disparity, that will be reflected in the grade.</p>
	  
    <br />
	  <br />
	
   <h4> PAPER COMMENTARIES (20 pts - 5 pts per commentary) </h4>
    Students should submit short commentary of each reading using the online submission system (in this format). 
    Commentaries are due by 7:00am the day of class; late commentaries will not be accepted. 
    <b>Students are required to read all the papers</b>. Commentary submissions are only required for those <a href="index.html">marked on the syllabus</a>.

    <p> We will drop your lowest-scoring commentary. This implies each student may opt to pass on one commentary for any reason: personal or family matters, conflicting deadlines, etc.. 
    There are no exemptions beyond this. Commentaries are graded on a check-plus (Excellent: 5pts) / check (Satisfactory: 3pts) / check-minus (Unsatisfactory: 1pt) scale.</p>
    
    <br />
	  <br />
	
    <h4> CO-LEADING ONE CLASS DISCUSSION (30 pts) </h4>
    For details on how to structure a discussion, go here. On their discussion day, students should submit their materials instead of their commentary using the online submission system. In evaluating your discussion, the course staff will ask the following questions:

  <ul>
    <li> Did you effectively extract the high-level points from readings and present them? </li>
    <li> Did you raise interesting and difficult questions about the readings? </li>
    <li> Did you 
    <li> Did you clearly review, describe, and summarize the paper's main technical contributions? If there is an important methodology or algorithm, you should explain how it works. If there are statistics, you should explain how and why they were produced.</li>
    <li> Did the discussion accomplish valuable learning goals for the students? (i.e., did students understand something about the readings at the end of class that may not have at the beginning.)</li>
    <li> Did you engage the students in discussion?</li>
    
    This is how your grade out of 30 is determined:
    Weak (0-16):	Yes to few of the questions above
    Proficient (17-25):	Yes to most but not all of the questions above
    Mastery (26-30): Yes to all of the questions above
