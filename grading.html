	  <h4> RESEARCH PROJECT (50 pts) </h4>
	  <p>Refer to the <a href="project.html">Project</a> page for more details this assignment.</p>

	   <p>Students will complete a mini-research project in groups of two. We encourge students to choose projects that are related to their own research or another research project on campus. Leveraging ongoing research increases your speed and ability to find define a good project, and enables you to leverage existing software and hardware infrastructure. 
		   The grade for this portion will be broken up as follows:</p>

    <ul> 
	    <li> <b> 5 pts - Project Abstract Draft, including research question </b>:
    The strength of the research problem (i.e., do pick something that's research, not just development) and appropriateness of the scope (i.e., don't pick something too large — it's only a 12-week term.) Is it executed in ways necessary to understand your research question? (It doesn't need to be functional in ways orthogonal to your research question.)</li>

	    <li> <b> 10 pts - Mid-term presentation </b>: A short presentation to the class explaining your problem motivation, research question, research methodology and progress to date. </li> 
    
	    <li> <b> 25 pts - Final Report, including execution</b>: Explanation of your ideas, motivation, and related work. How well did you figure out what you set out to learn?</li>

    	<li> <b> 10 pts - Project Presentation</b>: In general, both members of the team will receive the same grade. However, if there is a significant contribution disparity, that will be reflected in the grade.</li>
	  
    <br />
    <br />
	
   <h4> PAPER COMMENTARIES (20 pts - 5 pts per commentary) </h4>
    <p>Refer to the <a href="commentaries.html">Commentaries</a> page for more details about this assignment.</p>
	      
    <p>You should submit short commentary of each marked reading through the course submission platform (Quercus).<br/> 
    Commentaries are due by 7:00am the day of class; late commentaries will not be accepted. <br/>
    <b>Students are required to read all the papers</b>. Commentary submissions are only required for those <a href="shcedule.html">marked on the syllabus</a>.</p>

    <p> We will drop your lowest-scoring commentary. This implies each student may opt to pass on one commentary for any reason: personal or family matters, conflicting deadlines, etc.. 
    There are no exemptions beyond this. Commentaries are graded on a check-plus (Excellent: 5pts) / check (Satisfactory: 3pts) / check-minus (Unsatisfactory: 1pt) scale.</p>
    
    <br />
    <br />
	
    <h4> LEADING ONE CLASS DISCUSSION (30 pts) </h4>
    <p>Refer to the <a href="discussion.html">Discussion</a> page for instructions on how to prepare for this assignment.<br/>
	    In evaluating your discussion, the course instructor will ask the following questions:</p>

   <ul>
    <li> Did the discussion moderator effectively extract the high-level points from readings and present them? </li>
    <li> Did the discussion moderator raise interesting and difficult questions about the readings? </li>
    <li> Did the discussion moderator clearly review, describe, and summarize the paper's main technical contributions? If there is an important methodology or algorithm, you should explain how it works. If there are statistics, you should explain how and why they were produced.</li>
    <li> Did the discussion moderator demonstrate critical analysis of the paper's content? </li>
    <li> Did the discussion moderator discussion accomplish valuable learning goals for the audience? (i.e., did students understand something about the readings at the end of class that may not have at the beginning.)</li>
    <li> Did the discussion moderator engage the students in discussion?</li>
   </ul>
    
    This is how your grade out of 30 is determined:
	    <ul>
		    <li><b>Weak (0-16):</b> Yes to few of the questions above </li>
		    <li><b>Proficient (17-25):</b> Yes to most but not all of the questions above </li>
		    <li><b> Mastery (26-30):</b> Yes to all of the questions above </li>
	    </ul>
