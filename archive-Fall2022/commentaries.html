	      <br/>	 
	      In this course, you will complete six commentaries of research papers in visualization. 
	      <br/>The goal of paper commentaries are to get you to think critically about the research that a paper presents and why that research is important. The goal is <b>not</b> to summarize the paper — everyone reading your commentary will have already read the paper! The goal is to read your critique of the paper.
	      <br/><br/>	   
	      <p>
		<b>Some appropriate topics to address in a commentary are:</b>
		<br/> &#9642; why the paper does/doesn't seem important.
		<br/> &#9642; observations of novel methodology or methodology that seems suspect.
		<br/> &#9642; things in the paper that you disagree with or believe not to be true.
		<br/> &#9642; why the paper is/isn't effective at getting its message across.
		<br/> &#9642; how the paper has changed your opinion or outlook on a topic.
		<br/> &#9642; what ideas the paper inspires you.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		These aren't the only appropriate topics — feel free to discuss anything you deem important. (But remember not to summarize!) 
		Make sure that you discuss both positive topics and criticisms for each paper.
		Each topic should be a short paragraph (about 4 sentences in length).
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Commentaries are always due <b>on the Friday before the class</b> when relevant papers will be discussed, and are to be submitted through the course submission system (Quercus).
	      </p>

		Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation and the Application to the Development of Graphical Model -- Rating: 5/5
		<br/><br/>
		This paper provides a valuable basis for the study of graphical information visualizations in ascientific manner. The authors do a great job motivating this need through their many citationsfrom relevant science and psychology researchers about the un-scientific state of datavisualization at the time. The solution they propose, a ranking of elementary perceptual tasks, isparticularly valuable because it is generalizable and modular, in contrast to evaluating onlyspecific types of graphs.
		<br/><br/>
		Although the modular nature of the tasks is valuable, this also makes them more difficult to formconclusions about, since the tasks themselves are difficult to isolate. Their conjectures aboutwhich tasks make up which graphs are obviously a bit arbitrary: for example, I personally wouldargue that area is actually the most relevant task for pie charts, not angle. However, regardlessof whether or not the task classifications themselves are “correct,” the paper as a wholeencourages more scientific and detailed thinking about the impacts of varying visual elementson information visualizations, which I believe is its most important contribution.
		<br/><br/>
		It’s also excellent how the authors put their theory into practice through experimentation and thedesign of new visualizations, but it would have helped their point to have experimental evidenceto back the improvements they suggested. Additionally, with the more complex graphs theycreate and consider, the authors could ask more complex questions, too, not just prompt fordirect comparisons between data points. For example, the framed-rectangle maps may bebetter for direct state-state comparisons, but I would argue that the original shaded chart mayprovide a more easily glanceable overview of the entire country, although biased via state area(arguably, the framed-rectangles don’t really fix the area weighting of each state either.) Contextand purpose for each chart can differ and is perhaps not entirely considered.

		Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation and the Application to the Development of Graphical Model -- Rating: 4/5
		<br/><br/>

		I will start by saying that 4/5 is not what I would give this paper were I reviewing it. I would insteadapproach the review coordinator to get me off the committee as I have far too little backgroundknowledge of the field, nor its historical context, necessary to review this paper. It is quite clearly aformative paper, hence the 4/5. Were I feeling boorish enough to pass judgement on this paper inthe capacity of a reviewer, I would give it a 1/5.
		<br/><br/>
		My harsh measure of this paper does not come from its writing. Besides its verbosity, this paper iswell structured and written. It establishes the need for research guidelines in the nascent years ofInfoVis; provides a unifying theory of presentation; supports (in a limited fashion) its hypothesis withexperimentation; and offers implications for design. The most impeccable presentation is in theultimate section, wherein the authors employ their theory to visualization design in an internallyconsistent fashion.
		<br/><br/>
		The use of visuals and intuition was superb, if potentially misleading. The authors make use ofexperiments in which "the evidence appears so strong that it is taken prima facie to have establishedthe case." While this is a non-argument (a proof by obviousness, so to speak), it is nonethelesspersuasive to be able to grasp instantly what the authors are talking about.
		<br/><br/>
		One might take issue with the statistical analysis the authors performed in experimentation, thoughthis is not my primary issue with this paper. Usually, data are rescaled in order to fit normaldistributions and make parametric statistical tests appropriate. However, the authors clearly statethat non-normality was prevalent after log scaling. Later, the authors use bootstrapping to assertnormality, which makes one wonder why log scaling was deemed appropriate in the first place. Inmy opinion, nonparametric or Bayesian statistical tests would yield more convincing results.
		<br/><br/>
		My primary concern with this paper involves the dual purposes that it sets out to achieve.Specifically, it simultaneously presents a (very broad) axiomatic theory, then proceeds to justify itexperimentally by begging the question. This is not in regards to the efficacy of the elementaryperceptual tasks' ability to convey information correctly -- as the authors point out, the goal ofexperimentation is to determine if the hypothesis correctly predicts outcome -- but in the definitionof "correctly." I do not believe the authors provide a strict definition of "correct." Log error, thecriterion used to judge the efficacy of the perceptual tasks, suggests that "correctness" is"accuracy." However, this definition is explicitly rejected at the beginning of Section 3, whichappears to opt for "seeing patterns and structure not readily revealed by other means of data." Weare never told which patterns are the correct ones (maybe all of them, even the ones produced byrandom noise?).
		<br/><br>
		In sum, though the paper is well-written, it has a fundamental incongruency in its goals which it didnot resolve. This is a shame, as, judging by its citation count, it is likely that many have built theirwork on its theoretical underpinnings.

		Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation and the Application to the Development of Graphical Model -- Rating: 5/5
		<br/><br/>
		This paper is very compelling, as it formalized an approach to data representation that relied heavily on intuitions and rule-of-thumbs. It forces us to consider how the visual design of a graph can have an effect on our perception of the data itself. While this paper focused on 10 elementary perceptual tasks as the basisfor its theory, this paper also makes us consider how other visual design decisions can effect graph interpretability (e.g. information density, graphic design).
		<br/><br/>
		Cleveland and McGill order elementary perceptual tasks based on how accurately people perform. They also say that their study may not directly reflect how people perform perceptual judgments in real life (“Subjects will try and get the right answer might perform much more highly cognitive tasks than the basic perceptual tasks they perform in real life”). If that is the case, it makes me wonder on the significance of accuracy (as emphasized by the paper) versus less accurate data representations designed to highlight patterns (without being deceptive!) in order to communicate new findings in the data (especially for fine-grain patterns).
		<br/><br/>
		Because this paper is the first to establish a foundation for data representation, it also does an excellent job at laying the path for future research. For example, how does colour and hue affect data interpretation? Is accuracy the only criterion for increasing correct perceptions of patterns and behaviour? How do the functions of the data affect the design? This paper opened up an entire range of possible research topics for data visualization techniques.
		<br/><br/>
		While the paper does an excellent job creating the foundations for graphical methods of data analysis, I wish the authors put more emphasis on the importance of formalizing data representations aside from “... data analysis and presentation is largely unscientific”. For example, certain data representations can be misleading and deceptive. Adding supporting examples would have added more urgency and justification to the importance of accurate data representation.
