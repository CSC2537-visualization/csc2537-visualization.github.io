	      <h3> Commentaries </h3>
	      <br/>	 
		In this course, you will complete five commentaries of research papers in visualization. 
		<br/>The goal of paper commentaries are to get you to think critically about the research that a paper presents and why that research is important. 
      The goal is not to summarize the paper — everyone reading your commentary will have already read the paper!
		   
       <p>
       <b>Some appropriate topics to address in a commentary are:</b>
      <br/> &#9648; why the paper does/doesn't seem important
      <br/> &#9648; observations of novel methodology or methodology that seems suspect
      <br/> &#9648; things in the paper that you disagree with or believe not to be true
      <br/> &#9648; why the paper is/isn't effective at getting its message across
      <br/> &#9648; how the paper has changed your opinion or outlook on a topic
      </p>
      
      <br/>
    Of course, these aren't the only appropriate topics — feel free to discuss anything you deem important. 
    (But remember not to summarize!) 
    An excellent way to structure your commentary is to discuss three "positive" topics and one "criticism" for each paper 
    (or three "I like"s and one "I wish", for those familiar with that terminology). 
    Each topic should be a short paragraph (about 4 sentences in length).
    </p>

    <p>
    Additionally, we'd like everyone to rate each paper on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the best).
    These numbers will be used to determine which papers to keep on the syllabus for subsequent years.
    </p>

    <p>
    Commentaries are due at <b>7am on the day of class</b>, submitted through the course submission system.
    </p>

    As We May Think -- Rating: 5/5
    <br/><br/>
    This paper was fascinating because it forces us to consider technologies that nowadays we take for granted. In some ways Bush was overly optimistic; for example walnut-sized wearable cameras are uncommon (even though they are possible), likely because optical and physical constraints favor handheld sizes. In other ways he underestimated, such as the explosion of data. For example, some modern cameras can store ten thousand photos rather than a hundred.
    <br/><br/>
    Underestimating the data explosion is also apparent in the disconnect between the initial problem description ("publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record") and the first two-thirds of the paper, which describe technologies that would (and did!) exacerbate the issue by further proliferating data. Yet, he recognizes this issue later in the paper, and then goes on to predict search engines!
    <br/><br/>
    It is remarkable how many technologies are predicted in this paper: digital photography, speech recognition, search engines, centralized record-keeping for businesses, hypertext (even Wikipedia?). At the same time, many of the predicted implementations are distorted by technologies and practices common at the time, like "dry photography" or "a roomful of girls armed with simple keyboard punches". While these presumably served to make the hypotheses more accessible to readers of the time, is it even possible to hypothesize technology without such artifacts?
    <br/><br/>
    Aside from predictions, this paper is important for the way Bush frames science in the support of the human race, by augmenting the power of the human mind. It is likely that many of the scientists (and physicists in particular) that were his audience felt guilt and despair from the destruction wrought by advances in nuclear, and even conventional, weaponry in the war. In that social context, seeing science described as a powerful constructive tool for good must have been inspiring.

    <h4> How will it be graded? </h4>
		Commentaries are graded on a check-plus (<b>Excellent: 5 pts</b>) / check (<b>Satisfactory:3 pts</b>) / check-minus (<b>Unsatisfactory: 1 pt</b>) scale.
    
		<p>
		<h4> Submission instructions </h4>
		&#9648; Due no later than 7am on the day the commentary is due (see Schedule).</b><br/>
		&#9648; Submit your commentary in the PDF format on Quercus.
