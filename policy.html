	      <h3>Late policy </h3>
	      All assignments are to be submitted on the due date. On-time submissions are graded as normal. Late commentaries are not accepted.       
        Late submissions (project abstract, project report) incur a penalty:
		<ul class="regularlist">
		  <li> &lt;24h late incur a 10% penalty,</li>
		  <li> &lt;48h late incur a 30% penalty,</li>
		  <li> submissions more than 48h late <b>are not accepted</b> and earn a mark of 0.</li>
		</ul>
		<p />
		 
	      <h3>Re-marking </h3>
	      <p>Students requesting re-marking of an assignment must submit detailed reasons in writing to the instructors within 2 weeks after receiving the grade. The request must include the written reasons as to why the students believe the work was incorrectly marked. Re-evaluation appeals are at the discretion of the instructors. Note: adjustments in marks will be rare and could equally result in a lowering or raising of the mark. If a re-revaluation is completed by the instructors, the student must accept the resulting mark as the new mark, whether it goes up or down or remains the same. When appealing a re-evaluation decision, the student accepts this condition.</p>

	      <h3> Contact Policy </h3>
	      <p>When emailing the instructor, begin your subject line with "[CSC2537/STA2555]", followed by a meaningful phrase. Include your full (official) name in the body of the email. Allow up to 72 business hours for a reply. Violation to this policy may incur severe response delays. Contact us using official University of Toronto emails only.</p>
		
	      <h3>Resources </h3>
	      <p> Lectures slides and assignments will be posted on this webpage. It is your responsibility to check this page regularly for updates. Announcements will be posted on Quercus & sent as emails through Quercus. It is your responsibility to check Quercus & your email regularly for incidental communication and updates. </p>

	 	<h3> Copyright </h3>
		<p>  Reproduction and/or sharing of course materials is prohibited. Course materials include lecture slides, course notes, assignments, data and documents provided by the instructors. All such reproduction or dissemination is an infringement of copyright and is prohibited.

		<h3> Photographs, Audio & Video Recordings </h3>

	      <h3>Academic Offenses </h3>
	      <p> All the work you submit must be done by you (individually or within your group), and your work must not be submitted by anyone else. Plagarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. Read the <a href="http://www.artsandandscience.utoronto.ca/ofr/calendar/rules.htm">Rules and Regulations from the UofT Calendar</a> (especially the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters). You should also review <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fpitt/documents/plagiarism.html">this document regarding plagiarism </a> in the context of CS. "How Not to Plagiarize" and other advice on documentation format and methods of integrating sources are available on the <a href="http://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/">"Writing at UofT website"</a>.
