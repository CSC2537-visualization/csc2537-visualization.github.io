	      <h2> Draw Me A Visualization </h2>
	      <br/>	 
  	     	The goal for this first assignment is for students to think critically about visualization design, through
			   the creation of a visual representation of data where every design decision is justified: (i) with regard
			   to considerations of the guidelines and theory covered in class, and (ii) without the technical and practical constraints 
			   associated with implementation or data access, i.e. students can draw their vision as opposed to work with a charting tool.

		  <h2>Instructions</h2>
		</header>
		</section>

		In this assignment, you will <b>design a visualization</b> for a dataset of your choice (could be a real, simulated, or assumed one)
		and <b>provide a rigorous rationale</b> for your design choices. 
		You should in theory be ready to explain the contribution of <i>every pixel</i>  in the display. 
		
		</br>
		</br>
		<h4>Your Task.</h4>
		Your task is to (a) design a static visualization to effectively communicate a set of specific findings from data 
		and (b) provide a short write-up describing the main takeaway
		message that your visualization aims to convey (first paragraph), as well as a description of your design 
		(no more than 6 paragraphs).

		</br>
		</br>
		<h4>What data can I use?</h4>
	
		This is more of a thought experiment, than it is an exercise testing your competency finding data relevant to a problem or a test of 
		your implementation skills. As such, we leave the choice of the dataset open: you may decide to work with an existing real-world data set, 
		or simulated one, to ground your thinking -- this however may be limiting your creativity. We instead encourage you to start
		with a topic of your interest, and interesting insights one may want to learn about the topic, based on data. From there,
		you may be able to find relevant datasets, but we allow you to <i>assume</i> you have access to complete, up-to-date dataset that would 
		allow you to realize your visualization vision.
		</br>
		</br>
		For instance, I may be interested in communicating about the effect of climate change on populations of arctic birds and bears. 
		I can think about what a best visualization design would allow the reader: (a) to get a good sense of what "climate change" entails
		in this region, e.g. by crafting charts that allow to understand the evolution of temperatures, ice mass, and precipitations in their
		geographical context; and (b) to gain a detailed understanding of different populations of bears, birds, i.e., their head count 
		and other relevant information that may allow the reader to have a more complete perspective on other relevant factors, 
		e.g. availability of food (fish, fruits, etc...), presence of predators, reproduction cycles, etc, that allow to put numbers in 
		perspective (while also creating additional challenges for the visualization, which is the goal of the exercise).

		Here, we can assume we have all of this data available, that is, you are allowed to create a mock a dataset. 
		The goal of the exercise being: assuming we have all of this data handy, what would be a great visualization 
		design to communicate data-based insights?

		</br>
		</br>

		Now, if you are more comfortable working from an existing dataset, start by analyzing the data and collecting interesting 
		insights. After that, choose a particular set of related insights that answer a particular question, and create a 
		visualization that communicates the answer based on your insights. 

		</br>
		</br>
		<h4> What tool should I use? </h4>
		In short: Pick the tool that allow you to realize your vision, not a tool where your expressivity will be limited. 
		<br/>
		You are free to use any graphics tool you want â€” including drafting it by hand.	We strongly encourage you to use 
		paper and color crayons/pencils/markers, that allow free-form drawing, or alternately, tablet drawing applications such as Sketchbook 
		or Notability, and vector graphics applications such as Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer etc... In this exercise, the 
		focus is on the visualization concept and associated rationale behind design decisions, not the accuracy of the visualization with 
		regard to assumed underlying data. 
		

		</br>
		</br>

		<h4> Requirements for the visualization.</h4>
		Your chart image should be interpretable without recourse to your short write-up. 
		Do not forget to include title, axis labels, or legends as needed! You may also integrate annotations that would be relevant
		to the reader. Recall, however, that every design decision should be justified.  
		

		</br>
		</br>

		<h4> What should go in the write-up?</h4>
		In your write-up, you should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions. Provide a short write-up describing 
		the main takeaway message that your visualization aims to convey (first paragraph), as well as a description of your design 
		(no more than 6 paragraphs).
		</br>
		Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data and your specific question. 
		These decisions include the choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well 
		as the use of sorting or other data transformations, color schemes, supporting annotations, etc... 
		How do these decisions facilitate effective communication?  
		<br/>
		As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, you should also document what aspects 
		of the data you are attempting to communicate. In short, what story are you trying to tell? 
		What takeaway message do you want to convey to your audience? 
		You should also note which aspects of the data might be obscured due to your visualization design.

		  <h2>Grading </h2>
		</header>


		This assignment is worth 10% of your final grade. 

		</br>
		</br>

		We will determine scores by judging both the completeness and soundness of your design and the quality of the write-up. We
		will also look for consideration of audience, message, and intended task.

	Your written documents should be of top professional quality. Note that points will be subtracted subject to the following motives: missing components, poor presentation (e.g. poor formatting), lack of clarity (e.g. poor writing, poor organization).
