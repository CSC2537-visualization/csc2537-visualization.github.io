	      <br/>	 
  		  Each student will lead one discussion (25min per discussion) during the term. Here are your tasks. They are not optional.
		      
    <p>
		<h3> Tasks </h3>
		
    <br/>
    <b> Select a paper (by Jan. 22):</b><br/>
    The papers selection for this assignment, and associated date can be found on the <a href="schedule.html">Course Schedule</a>.
    Each student will be assigned to one paper. Please use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/84YQjIZxbOpVEUd03">google form</a> to specify your top three preferred choices and your three least preferred choices, no later than <b>Jan 22</b>.
    
    <br/> <br/>
    <b>Before your discussion day:</b>
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Make a small presentation slideshow which tackles the main points and more importantly, includes 3-4 discussion points in the slides where the class will break into different groups and discuss them.
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; For each slide, estimate how long you expect to spend on it (e.g. 1 min, 2 min). This will help you plan the overall timing of your presentation so that while you are presenting, you will be able to recognize if you are running behind or ahead and adjust accordingly.
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; If you have a soft voice, practice enunciating and speaking in a loud lecture voice.
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Coordinate with the other discussants for that day. Weave ideas from your peers' commentaries into the discussion and credit their authors. It's a nice way to encourage the excellent, thoughtful comments exchanged while preparing for the dicussion.
    
    <br/> <br/>
    <b>On your discussion day (25 min per discussion):</b>
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Submit your preparatory materials in pdf form (notes and slides etc.) via Quercus by 10am.
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Don't talk into your laptop; talk to the class ;)
    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; If, during your discussion, you start running short on time, don't speed up. Instead, skip less important slides/topics/points. It's good to have a plan ahead of time of what you'll cut if pressed for time.

    <h3> Discussion Guidelines </h3>
	  Most importantly, <b>begin your preparation by defining a very clear learning goal for the class</b></p>. 
    What will the audience understand at the end of class that they may not have at the beginning? 
    Decide on 3-4 key ideas from the readings that you would like the students to understand deeply, 
	and structure your discussion strategy around that.
	As part of that, your discussion should accomplish the following:

	<br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Briefly summarize the main paper (and additional other papers you read to deepen
	your understanding of the subject matter) 
    for those who may have not read them as closely as others. This should take no more than 10 minutes. 
    You are strongly encouraged to read other papers relevant to the presented article. You can summarize the
    papers together or separately, whichever you prefer. 
    Don't worry about thoroughly summarizing every section of the paper, 
    just focus on the key parts that everyone should understand in order to accomplish your learning goals.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Lead a conversation about the papers, covering topics much like those that would be
    covered in a <a href="commentaries.html">commentary</a>. 
    You don't need to provide all the content, but you need to be willing to step in at any point when no one else
    is providing the content. 
    Don't plan on giving a 45-minute monologue (you are given 25 minutes for your presentation and discussion). 
    Do come in with a clear set of goals for what you would like to convey.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Get people talking! One great way to do this is to break people into pairs or small
    groups for a minute or two to think about a question. 
    Pairs and small groups give more students a chance to participate, and they help students get ideas and words flowing. 
    And by a minute or two, we literally mean 60 or 120 seconds. 
    Inside of class, pair/small group discussion longer than a minute or two tends to lose momentum and fall off track.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Cover both high- and low-level parts of the paper(s). 
    What does this research mean? 
    High level concepts are important, they help us anchor on the topic and give us some motivation for a research topic. 
    How was this research accomplished? 
    What technical concepts and methodological strategies were employed? 
    Really dive into a key detail of how a study was performed, or whether the right research question was asked. 
    If it's a technical paper, the discussion should help students deeply understand the key technical ideas.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; When explaining technical formulas, diagrams, graphs, etc.,
    try to explain what they mean conceptually, rather than just describing each variable.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; Examples are a great way to explain a concept. Walk the class through
    a concrete example to explain how a system or method works. 
    Use examples that students can relate to in their lives or research projects.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; In general, keep your slides simple. 
    Make sure the content of your slides compliments what you are saying and does not distract from it. 
    If there is a short video or demo that illustrates something from the paper, show it! 
    However, don't make the class sit through a 5-minute long video. 
    Keep it short and sweet - pick the 1 or 2 minutes that are most important.

    <br/> &nbsp; &#9648; &nbsp; For your discussion questions: the more specific the better. 
    Do not ask questions that could be answered without having read the paper (in general, questions that start
    with "what do you think..." or "what is your opinion on..." fall into this category). 
    Instead, focus on concepts from the paper (e.g. "what did <author> think about...", "what are the limitations of ..."). 
    Centering questions around a specific example situation is a great way to make them more focused and specific. 
    Remember to discuss the discusion question in class and correct common misconceptions.

<br/><br/>
      
      <p>We're very open to students trying something innovative or different during the discussion they lead. 
	If you are going to do something "unusual", make sure to talk with us about it several days beforehand so
	that we can help you determine if it is appropriate and achievable.</p>
      
      <p>Arrive early to class on your discussion day so you aren't flustered. 
	If you're going to use the videoprojector, test your setting <b>prior</b> to the beginning of the class.
	Encourage people to sit towards the front — it gives the discussion more energy. 
	An important part of teaching well is leading class with energy and enthusiasm.</p>
