	      <br/>	 
		In this course, you will complete five commentaries of research papers in visualization. 
		<br/>The goal of paper commentaries are to get you to think critically about the research that a paper presents and why that research is important. 
      The goal is <b>not</b> to summarize the paper — everyone reading your commentary will have already read the paper! The goal is to read your critique of the paper.
	<br/><br/>	   
       <p>
       <b>Some appropriate topics to address in a commentary are:</b>
      <br/> &#9648; why the paper does/doesn't seem important
      <br/> &#9648; observations of novel methodology or methodology that seems suspect
      <br/> &#9648; things in the paper that you disagree with or believe not to be true
      <br/> &#9648; why the paper is/isn't effective at getting its message across
      <br/> &#9648; how the paper has changed your opinion or outlook on a topic
      </p>
      
       <br/>
    Of course, these aren't the only appropriate topics — feel free to discuss anything you deem important. 
    (But remember not to summarize!) 
    An excellent way to structure your commentary is to discuss three "positive" topics and one "criticism" for each paper 
    (or three "I like"s and one "I wish", for those familiar with that terminology). 
    Each topic should be a short paragraph (about 4 sentences in length).
    </p>

    <p>
    Additionally, we'd like everyone to rate each paper on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the best).
    These numbers will be used to determine which papers to keep on the syllabus for subsequent years.
    </p>

    <p>
    Commentaries are due at <b>7am on the day of class</b>, submitted through the course submission system (Quercus).

    As We May Think -- Rating: 5/5
    <br/><br/>
    This paper was fascinating because it forces us to consider technologies that nowadays we take for granted. In some ways Bush was overly optimistic; for example walnut-sized wearable cameras are uncommon (even though they are possible), likely because optical and physical constraints favor handheld sizes. In other ways he underestimated, such as the explosion of data. For example, some modern cameras can store ten thousand photos rather than a hundred.
    <br/><br/>
    Underestimating the data explosion is also apparent in the disconnect between the initial problem description ("publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record") and the first two-thirds of the paper, which describe technologies that would (and did!) exacerbate the issue by further proliferating data. Yet, he recognizes this issue later in the paper, and then goes on to predict search engines!
    <br/><br/>
    It is remarkable how many technologies are predicted in this paper: digital photography, speech recognition, search engines, centralized record-keeping for businesses, hypertext (even Wikipedia?). At the same time, many of the predicted implementations are distorted by technologies and practices common at the time, like "dry photography" or "a roomful of girls armed with simple keyboard punches". While these presumably served to make the hypotheses more accessible to readers of the time, is it even possible to hypothesize technology without such artifacts?
    <br/><br/>
    Aside from predictions, this paper is important for the way Bush frames science in the support of the human race, by augmenting the power of the human mind. It is likely that many of the scientists (and physicists in particular) that were his audience felt guilt and despair from the destruction wrought by advances in nuclear, and even conventional, weaponry in the war. In that social context, seeing science described as a powerful constructive tool for good must have been inspiring.

    Direct Manipulation Interfaces -- Rating: 3/5
    <br/><br/>
	This paper goes a long way to refining the concept of ease-of-use. While we have an intuitive understanding of the concept (as Justice Stewart said, "I know it when I see it"), having a model of *why* something is easy to use is critical to the design of successful interfaces. The metaphors of cognitive distance, and gulfs of execution and evaluation, are now widely-used.
 	<br/><br/>
	Despite the huge value of its contribution, I rated this paper low because it is poorly-written.* It is significantly longer than it needs to be, as many ideas are repeated with slight changes of phrasing but without new insight. Worse still, some terms are woefully undefined; for example, how do we know when an interface is "unobtrusive"? Saying a "feeling of direct engagement" requires "semantic and articulatory directness" is circular. There are relatively few citations for a paper this length, and many conjectures are unqualified or uncorroborated.
 	<br/><br/>
	The first example of visual programming is a bad use case for direct manipulation; these interfaces have been tried and are almost universal failures. The success of direct manipulation in this example is not visible until Figure 2, where the user can circle the desired data subset and perform a specific action (a linear regression) on that subset; this is something that would be very difficult without direct manipulation. In contrast, using the mouse to position and wire-up a log operator is demonstrably less efficient than typing "y = log x". I was looking forward to a meaningful discussion of the problems of direct manipulation, but this did not come until the very end, and was insufficient.
	 <br/><br/>
	The model of interface-as-representation, as opposed to interface-as-conversation, is valuable for designing direct interfaces. It reminded me of the inconsistency between using the trackpad to scroll documents on a MacBook and using the touchscreen on an iPhone. The representation implies a "way of thinking about the domain": on the MacBook, brushing down scrolls down, because you are pushing the "view"; while on the iPhone, brushing down scrolls up, because you are pushing the "page".
 	<br/><br/>
	* Fortunately, Norman's book is very well-written.

    User Technology: From Pointing to Pondering -- Rating: 5/5
	<br/><br/>
	This paper is an excellent example of a scientific approach to Human-Computer Interaction: hypotheses are proposed and then tested via user studies. Models of human behavior that are not directly corroborated are cited from earlier studies (e.g., working memory and unit-task behavior), adding significant credence to the arguments.
	<br/><br/>
	Furthermore, it demonstrates the value of using simple models of human behavior: it is feasible to test them through experiments. And yet low-level theories (such as the Keystroke-Level Model) are straightforward to apply to a wide domain of problems (e.g., predicting expert user performance when you can only observe novices). The crux of cognitive psychology is breaking down the complex process of thought into fine-grained steps than can be modeled and studied.
	<br/><br/>
	The idea that user interface should simplify the necessary mental model of the system is also powerful, and practical advice for system designers. Though I believe the authors were correct in saying that it is "under-appreciated"; it continues to be so, as much of design in industry becomes mired in superficial aspects like the size and placement of buttons, the legibility of text, and choice of wording.
	<br/><br/>
	As a minor issue, some concepts could use further clarification, such as the distinction between "task space", "methods space" and "model space". In addition, this paper is atypical of traditional research papers in that it is written (intentionally) in a narrative style.
