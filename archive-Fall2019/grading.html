		  <h3> <i class="fas fa-puzzle-piece"></i> RESEARCH PROJECT (60 pts) </h3>
		  <p>Refer to the <a href="project.html">Project</a> page for more details this assignment.</p>

	  	  <p>Students will complete a mini-research project individually, or in groups of two (depending on the cohort). We encourge you to choose projects that are related to your own research or another research project on campus. Leveraging ongoing research increases your speed and ability to find define a good project, and enables you to leverage existing software and hardware infrastructure. 
		  The grade for this portion will be broken up as follows:</p>


		  <center>
		  <table class="eighty">
		    <tr></tr>
		     <tr>
		       <td> <b> Project Abstract - 5 pts</b></td>		
		     </tr>
		     <tr> <td>
		       The strength of the research problem (i.e., do pick something that's research, not just development) and appropriateness of the scope (i.e., don't pick something too large â€” it's only a 12-week term.) Is it executed in ways necessary to understand your research question? (It doesn't need to be functional in ways orthogonal to your research question.) 
		       </td>
		     </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b> Mid-term Video Presentation - 15 pts </b><b> 
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> A short video explaining your problem motivation, research question and research methodology </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		       <td> <b> Peer Feedback on Video Presentation - 5 pts </b><b> 
		     </tr>
		     <tr>
		       <td> Comments, suggestions and questions to other students on their project </td>
		     </tr>
		      <tr>
		       <td> <b> Final Presentation - 15 pts </b><b> 
		     </tr>
		     <tr>
		       <td>  A presentation of your research results to the class (and possibly external guests). </td>
		     </tr>
		    <tr>
		       <td> <b> Final Report - 20 pts </b><b> 
		     </tr>
		     <tr>
		       <td>  Explanation of your ideas, motivation, and related work. How well did you figure out what you set out to learn? </td>
		     </tr>

		  </table>
		  </center>
		     
		     

	          <p> In general, for teams of two students, both members of the team will receive the same grade. However, if there is a significant contribution disparity, that will be reflected in the grade.</p>
    	
    	<hr>
    	
	
   		<h3> <i class="fas fa-marker"></i> PAPER COMMENTARIES (20 pts) </h3>
    		<p>Refer to the <a href="commentaries.html">Commentaries</a> page for more details about this assignment.</p>
	        
	 	<p>Students are required to read <i>all</i> the papers listed in the syllabus. Commentary submissions are only required for those <a href="shcedule.html">marked on the syllabus</a>. </p>

    		<p> We will drop your lowest-scoring commentary. This implies each student may opt to pass on one commentary for any reason: personal or family matters, conflicting deadlines, etc.. 
    		There are no exemptions beyond this. When evaluating commentaries, we will look at organization, conciseness and relevance of the discussion, as well as whether the discussion includes critical thoughts and personal reflection. Commentaries are graded on a check-plus, check, check-minus scale:

		  <center>
		   <table class="eighty">
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b>Excellent (4 pts)</b> </td>
		      <td> Organized, concise and relevant discussion that develops critical thoughts and personal reflection. </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b>Satisfactory (2-3 pts)</b></td>
		      <td> Discussion is relevant, but lacks depth and/or is not quite well organized and/or lacks conciseness and clarity. </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b>Unsatisfactory (0-1 pt)</b> </td>
		      <td> Discussion is too short, too basic, off-topic and/or difficult to understand.</td>
		    </tr>
		  </table>
		  </center>

	          
		 
    	
    	<hr>
    	
	
    		<h3> <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> LEADING ONE CLASS DISCUSSION (20 pts) </h3>
    		<p>Refer to the <a href="discussion.html">Discussion</a> page for instructions on how to prepare for this assignment.</p>
							 
		<p>Students are required to read a research paper in depth, and lead a class discussion on the research question, contributions, limitations and conclusions of the paper (and beyond). 
		In evaluating your discussion, the course instructor will ask the following questions:</p>


 <center>
		  <table class="eighty">
		    <tr></tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b>Overview & Main contribution (5 pts)</b> </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> Did the discussion moderator effectively extract the high-level points from the readings and present them? Did the discussion moderator clearly review, describe, and summarize the paper's main technical contributions? If there is an important methodology or algorithm, you should explain how it works. If there are statistics, you should explain how and why they were produced. </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b>Questions for discussion & Critique (5 pts)</b> </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> Did the discussion moderator raise interesting and difficult questions about the readings?
		       Did the discussion moderator demonstrate critical analysis of the paper's content?</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> <b>Going further (5 pts)</b> </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> Did the discussion moderator investigate the literature relevant to some aspects the paper discussed, and conveyed additional knowledge in the discussion? (i.e., did students understand something about the reading at the end of class that may not have at the beginning?)</td>
		    </tr>
		     <tr>
		      <td> <b>Discussion moderation (5 pts)</b> </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td> Did the discussion moderator engage the students in discussion?</td>
		    </tr>
		    
		  </table>
		  </center>
